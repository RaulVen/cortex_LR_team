## Feasibility study for loss runs reports automathic info extraction.
study of feasibility in order to determinate if it's possible extract relevant information for loss runs reports in automatic way applying natural language processing (NLP), and optical characters recognition (OCR).

Due the high variations in the lossruns report formats a single search  rule for the topics (interest points) is not optimal, several search algorithm must be tested and the results will give a heads up if the process is pertinent or not. 

the algorithm to search the topics will be develop from Jan 11 to Jan 14 2021 and the assignaments are:
	1.- Linear to the rigth: Romulo T. 
	2.- Linear to bottom: Raul V.
	3.- Linear cross search: Eduardo S.

The testing files are: :LT001.pdf,...LT004.pdf
